Orginal work by Thomas Munzer: https://github.com/tmunzer/get-a-key/tree/2.0
Thomas stopped support for this API, we will edit and maintain this solely for our own internal use.

We do recommend using https://github.com/Jeroen52/get-a-key/tree/2.0 as this one has a recent fix that allows the API to work with extremecloud IQ's network now.

# Stichting iHUB's edition of 'get-a-key'
This fork of the original repository is specifically meant to fit our company, though we do intent to keep it open and customizeable.
